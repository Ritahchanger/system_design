## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. MTProto Protocol

Telegram developed its own protocol called MTProto (Mobile Telegram Protocol) designed for reliable, secure, and efficient messaging.

**MTProto Characteristics:**
- **Custom Binary Protocol**: Optimized for mobile networks
- **Built-in Encryption**: Multiple encryption layers
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection and message recovery
- **Multi-Datacenter Support**: Seamless switching between data centers
- **Compression**: Efficient data compression algorithms

**Protocol Stack:**

    END_TO_END --> SERVER_CLIENT
    SERVER_CLIENT --> TRANSPORT_CRYPTO
    
    TRANSPORT_LAYER --> TCP
    TRANSPORT_LAYER --> HTTP
    TRANSPORT_LAYER --> PROXY
```

### 2. Cloud-First Architecture

Unlike many messaging platforms, Telegram is designed as a cloud-first service where messages are stored on servers and synchronized across all devices.

**Cloud Benefits:**
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Access messages from any device instantly
- **Unlimited Storage**: No local storage limitations
- **Fast Device Switching**: Instant access from new devices
- **Message History**: Complete message history always available
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across all platforms

**Synchronization Architecture:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D1 as Device 1
    participant TS as Telegram Server
    participant D2 as Device 2
    participant D3 as Device 3
    
    D1->>TS: Send Message
    TS->>TS: Store Message in Cloud
    TS->>D2: Push Message
    TS->>D3: Push Message
    
    Note over D2: User opens Telegram
    D2->>TS: Request Updates
    TS->>D2: Send Recent Messages
    
    Note over D3: New device added
    D3->>TS: Login & Sync Request
    TS->>D3: Send Complete Message History
```

## Dual Encryption Architecture

### 1. Server-Client Encryption (Regular Chats)

Regular Telegram chats use server-client encryption, allowing for cloud storage and advanced features while maintaining security.

**Regular Chat Features:**
- **Cloud Storage**: Messages stored encrypted on Telegram servers
- **Multi-Device Access**: Access from unlimited devices
- **Message Search**: Server-side search across all messages  
- **Large Groups**: Support for massive group chats
- **Bots Integration**: Rich bot ecosystem and API access

**Encryption Flow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client Side"
        PLAINTEXT[Original Message]
        CLIENT_ENCRYPT[Client Encryption]
        ENCRYPTED_MSG[Encrypted Message]
    end
    
    subgraph "Server Side"
        SERVER_DECRYPT[Server Decryption]

        TARGET_PLAINTEXT[Delivered Message]
    end
    
    PLAINTEXT --> CLIENT_ENCRYPT
    CLIENT_ENCRYPT --> ENCRYPTED_MSG
    ENCRYPTED_MSG --> SERVER_DECRYPT
    SERVER_DECRYPT --> SERVER_PROCESS
    SERVER_PROCESS --> SERVER_ENCRYPT
    SERVER_ENCRYPT --> TARGET_DECRYPT
    TARGET_DECRYPT --> TARGET_PLAINTEXT
```

### 2. End-to-End Encryption (Secret Chats)

Secret Chats provide end-to-end encryption where only the communicating parties can read the messages.

**Secret Chat Characteristics:**
- **Device-Specific**: Limited to two specific devices
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Keys change with each message
- **Self-Destruct**: Automatic message deletion
- **No Cloud Storage**: Messages not stored on servers
- **Screenshot Detection**: Notification when screenshots are taken (mobile)

**E2E Encryption Process:**
```mermaid

    participant A as Alice Device
    participant TS as Telegram Server
    participant B as Bob Device
    
    Note over A,B: Key Exchange (Diffie-Hellman)
    A->>TS: Public Key + Key Hash
    TS->>B: Forward Key Exchange
    B->>TS: Public Key Response
    TS->>A: Forward Response
    
    Note over A,B: Establish Shared Secret
    A->>A: Generate Shared Secret
    B->>B: Generate Shared Secret
    
    Note over A,B: Encrypted Communication
    A->>A: Encrypt Message with Shared Key
    A->>TS: Send Encrypted Message
    TS->>B: Forward Encrypted Message (No Decryption)
    B->>B: Decrypt Message with Shared Key
```
