## Common System Design Patterns

### Load Balancing Strategies

- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly across servers
- **Least Connections**: Route to server with fewest active connections
- **IP Hash**: Route based on client IP for session persistence
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Distribute based on server capacity

### Caching Patterns

- **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache, load on cache miss
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-Back**: Write to cache first, async write to database
- **Refresh-Ahead**: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

### Database Scaling Patterns

- **Replication**: Master-slave for read scaling
- **Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning for write scaling
- **Partitioning**: Logical data separation
- **Federation**: Splitting databases by function

## Best Practices

### General Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest solution that meets requirements
2. **Scale Gradually**: Add complexity only when needed
3. **Measure Everything**: Monitor and measure before optimizing
4. **Plan for Failure**: Design for resilience and fault tolerance
5. **Security First**: Build security into every layer

### Common Commands

```bash
# Navigate to specific topic
cd api-gateways/
cd caching/
cd scalability/
cd security/

# View documentation
cd docs/
ls
```

### Key Metrics to Consider

- **Latency**: Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage (99.9%, 99.99%)
- **Consistency**: Data consistency guarantees
- **Durability**: Data loss prevention

### Scale Estimation Quick Reference

- 1 million users ≈ 10-100 requests/second
- 1 billion users ≈ 10,000-100,000 requests/second
- 1 TB data ≈ 1-10 database servers
- 1 PB data ≈ distributed storage required
