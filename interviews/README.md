## Quick Start

### For Interviewers

1. **Start with the process guide**: [interview-process.md](docs/engineer-interview-guide/interview-process.md)
2. **Choose appropriate level**: 
   - [Junior Guide](docs/engineer-interview-guide/junior-guide.md) for 0-3 years experience
   - [Senior Guide](docs/engineer-interview-guide/senior-guide.md) for 5+ years experience
3. **Select practice questions**: From [practise-questions/](docs/practise-questions/)
4. **Apply evaluation frameworks**: Use scoring rubrics and assessment criteria provided

### For Candidates

1. **Understand the process**: Review [interview-process.md](docs/engineer-interview-guide/interview-process.md)
2. **Practice at your level**:
   - Junior engineers: Start with [junior-questions.md](docs/practise-questions/junior-questions.md)
   - Senior engineers: Focus on [senior-questions.md](docs/practise-questions/senior-questions.md)
3. **Master estimation techniques**: Study [trade-offs-decisions.md](docs/estimation-techniques/trade-offs-decisions.md)
4. **Learn capacity planning**: Review [capacity-planning.md](docs/interview-process-framework/capacity-planning.md)

## Best Practices

### For Conducting Interviews

#### Preparation
- Review candidate's background and adjust question difficulty
- Prepare follow-up questions based on their experience level
- Set up whiteboarding tools (physical or digital)

#### During Interview
- Start with clarifying questions and requirements gathering
- Guide without providing solutions
- Probe for deeper understanding with "what if" scenarios
- Focus on thought process over perfect solutions

#### Evaluation
- Use consistent scoring rubrics
- Document specific examples of candidate responses
- Consider level-appropriate expectations
- Provide constructive feedback

### For Interview Preparation

#### Study Strategy
1. **Master fundamentals**: Start with basic concepts before advanced topics
2. **Practice regularly**: Work through questions at increasing complexity
3. **Learn from examples**: Study real-world system architectures
4. **Mock interviews**: Practice explaining solutions clearly

#### Common Preparation Areas
- **Database fundamentals**: ACID properties, indexing, partitioning
- **Caching strategies**: Multi-level caching, cache invalidation
- **Load balancing**: Algorithms, health checks, failover
- **Distributed systems**: Consistency models, consensus algorithms
- **Security basics**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
