## Overview

### Purpose
This collection provides system design practice questions specifically for senior engineers (5+ years experience). These questions focus on distributed systems, scalability, trade-off analysis, and architectural decision-making at enterprise scale.

### Key Differences from Junior Questions
- **Scale Complexity:** Systems serving millions/billions of users
- **Distributed Systems Focus:** Multi-region, high availability, consistency models
- **Production Considerations:** Monitoring, operations, disaster recovery
- **Business Context:** Cost optimization, team scaling, organizational impact
- **Deep Trade-offs:** Complex architectural decisions with multiple valid approaches

### Connection to Other Guides
- **Foundation:** Build upon [Junior Questions](./junior-questions.md) concepts
- **Evaluation:** Reference [Senior Interview Guide](../engineer-interview-guide/senior-guide.md)
- **Decision Making:** Use [Trade-offs Guide](../estimation-techniques/trade-offs-decisions.md) extensively
- **Process:** Follow [Interview Process](../engineer-interview-guide/interview-process.md) structure

#### System Evolution Planning
**Questions to Explore:**
- How would you evolve this system from 1M to 100M users?
- What would you change if availability requirements increased to 99.99%?
- How would you adapt the architecture for global expansion?
- What would be the migration strategy from the current system?
