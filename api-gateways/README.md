## Overview

An API Gateway serves as a single entry point for all client requests in a microservices architecture. It acts as a reverse proxy that routes requests to appropriate backend services while providing cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, monitoring, and request/response transformation.

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client Applications] --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway --> Auth[Authentication Service]
    Gateway --> Service1[User Service]
    Gateway --> Service2[Order Service]
    Gateway --> Service3[Payment Service]
    Gateway --> Service4[Notification Service]
    
    Gateway --> Cache[(Cache Layer)]
    Gateway --> Monitor[Monitoring & Logging]
```

## System Architecture

The API Gateway implements a layered architecture that provides scalability, security, and maintainability. 

For detailed architectural decisions and design patterns, see:

- üîß [Implementation Patterns](docs/patterns.md)

- ‚ö° [**Routing**](docs/routing.md) - Request routing strategies and configuration
- üîí [**Security**](docs/security.md) - Authentication, authorization, and security best practices

### Decision Framework
- ‚öñÔ∏è [**Pros & Cons**](docs/pros-cons.md) - Trade-offs and decision criteria for API Gateway adoption

## Quick Start

### Basic Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant G as API Gateway
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant S as Backend Service
    participant Cache as Cache Store
    
    C->>G: HTTP Request
    G->>A: Validate Token
    A->>G: Token Valid
    G->>Cache: Check Cache
    Cache-->>G: Cache Miss
    G->>S: Forward Request
    S->>G: Response
    G->>Cache: Store Response
    G->>C: HTTP Response
```

### Configuration Example

```yaml
gateway:
  routes:
    - path: "/api/users/*"
      service: "user-service"
      methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
      auth_required: true
      rate_limit: 1000/hour
      
    - path: "/api/orders/*"
      service: "order-service"
      methods: ["GET", "POST"]
      auth_required: true
      cache_ttl: 300
      
  security:
    jwt_secret: "${JWT_SECRET}"
    cors_enabled: true
    
  caching:
    provider: "redis"
    default_ttl: 600
```

## Implementation Patterns

The system supports multiple implementation patterns based on your architectural needs:

### 1. Centralized Gateway Pattern
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Single API Gateway] --> B[Service 1]
    A --> C[Service 2]
    A --> D[Service 3]
    A --> E[Service N]
```

### 2. Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web BFF] --> D[Shared Services]
    B[Mobile BFF] --> D
    C[Partner BFF] --> D
    
    D --> E[User Service]
    D --> F[Order Service]
    D --> G[Payment Service]
```

For detailed pattern implementations, see [patterns.md](docs/patterns.md).

## Security Considerations

Security is implemented through multiple layers:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0, API keys
- **Authorization**: Role-based and attribute-based access control
- **Transport Security**: TLS/SSL encryption
- **Input Validation**: Request sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: DDoS protection and abuse prevention

For comprehensive security guidelines, refer to [security.md](docs/security.md).

## Performance & Scaling

### Scaling Strategies

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Horizontal Scaling"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        GW1[Gateway 1]
        GW2[Gateway 2]
        GW3[Gateway 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Caching Layer"
        Redis[(Redis Cluster)]
        CDN[CDN]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        S1[Service 1]
        S2[Service 2]
        S3[Service 3]
    end
    
    LB --> GW1
    LB --> GW2
    LB --> GW3
    
    GW1 --> Redis
    GW2 --> Redis
    GW3 --> Redis
    
    GW1 --> S1
    GW2 --> S2
    GW3 --> S3
```

Key performance optimizations covered in our documentation:
- Connection pooling and keep-alive strategies ([scaling.md](docs/scaling.md))
- Intelligent caching mechanisms ([caching.md](docs/caching.md))
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance ([patterns.md](docs/patterns.md))

## Monitoring & Observability

Comprehensive monitoring includes:

- **Metrics**: Request rates, response times, error rates
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing across services
- **Health Checks**: Service health and dependency monitoring

```mermaid
graph LR
    Gateway[API Gateway] --> Metrics[Metrics Store]
    Gateway --> Logs[Log Aggregator]
    Gateway --> Traces[Tracing System]
    
    Metrics --> Dashboard[Monitoring Dashboard]
    Logs --> Dashboard
    Traces --> Dashboard
    
    Dashboard --> Alerts[Alert Manager]
```
