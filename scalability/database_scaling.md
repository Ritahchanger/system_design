## Introduction

Database scaling is the process of increasing a database's capacity to handle more data, transactions, and concurrent users. As applications grow, databases often become the bottleneck. This document explores various strategies to scale databases effectively.

**Why Database Scaling Matters:**
- Applications can handle increased load
- Improved response times and user experience
- Better fault tolerance and availability
- Support for business growth

**Related Documents:**
- See [vertical_scaling.md](./vertical_scaling.md) for hardware-based scaling approaches
- See [horizontal_scaling.md](./horizontal_scaling.md) for distributed system patterns
- See [caching_strategies.md](./caching_strategies.md) for reducing database load
- See [eventual_consistency.md](./eventual_consistency.md) for consistency models in distributed databases

## Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up)

Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single database server by adding more resources.

### Approach
- Increase CPU cores and processing power
- Add more RAM for larger in-memory operations
- Upgrade to faster storage (SSD, NVMe)
- Optimize network bandwidth

### Advantages
- Simple to implement (no application changes)
- Maintains ACID properties
- No data distribution complexity
- Consistent data model

### Limitations
- Hardware limits (physical constraints)
- Single point of failure
- Downtime during upgrades
- Diminishing returns on cost
- Eventually hits a ceiling

### When to Use
- Small to medium-sized applications
- When strong consistency is critical
- As a first step before horizontal scaling
- For workloads that benefit from single-machine optimization

**Reference:** See [vertical_scaling.md](./vertical_scaling.md) for detailed vertical scaling strategies.

## Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out)

Horizontal scaling distributes data and load across multiple database servers.

    A[Application Layer] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[DB Server 1]
    B --> D[DB Server 2]
    B --> E[DB Server 3]
    B --> F[DB Server N]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style B fill:#fff4e1
    style C fill:#e8f5e9
    style D fill:#e8f5e9
    style E fill:#e8f5e9
    style F fill:#e8f5e9
```

### Key Concepts
- **Shared-Nothing Architecture:** Each node operates independently
- **Data Distribution:** Data is spread across multiple nodes
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple servers handle requests simultaneously
- **Elastic Scaling:** Add/remove nodes based on demand

### Advantages
- Near-infinite scalability
- Improved fault tolerance
- No single point of failure
- Cost-effective (commodity hardware)
- Flexible capacity management

### Challenges
- Complex data distribution
- Consistency management
- Cross-shard queries are expensive
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between nodes

**Reference:** See [horizontal_scaling.md](./horizontal_scaling.md) for distributed system architectures.

## Replication Strategies

Replication creates copies of data across multiple database servers for redundancy and read scaling.

### Master-Slave Replication (Primary-Replica)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application] -->|Writes| B[Master DB]
    A -->|Reads| C[Slave DB 1]
    A -->|Reads| D[Slave DB 2]
    A -->|Reads| E[Slave DB 3]
    
    B -.->|Replication| C
    B -.->|Replication| D
    B -.->|Replication| E
    
    style B fill:#ffcccc
    style C fill:#ccffcc
    style D fill:#ccffcc
    style E fill:#ccffcc
```

**Characteristics:**
- Single master handles all writes
- Multiple slaves handle reads
- Asynchronous or synchronous replication
- Reduces read load on master

**Use Cases:**
- Read-heavy workloads (90% reads, 10% writes)
- Reporting and analytics queries
- Geographic distribution for read performance

### Master-Master Replication (Multi-Master)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application Region 1] -->|Read/Write| B[Master DB 1]
    C[Application Region 2] -->|Read/Write| D[Master DB 2]
    
    B <-.->|Bi-directional Replication| D
    
    style B fill:#ffcccc
    style D fill:#ffcccc
```

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple masters accept writes
- Bi-directional replication
- Requires conflict resolution
- Higher availability

**Challenges:**
- Write conflicts
- Complex conflict resolution logic
- Eventual consistency issues
- Data consistency guarantees

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Replication

**Synchronous:**
- Write confirmed after all replicas update
- Strong consistency
- Higher latency
- Risk of availability issues if replica is down

**Asynchronous:**
- Write confirmed immediately
- Lower latency
- Risk of data loss if master fails
- Eventual consistency

**Reference:** See [eventual_consistency.md](./eventual_consistency.md) for consistency models.

## Sharding (Partitioning)

Sharding divides data across multiple databases, with each shard containing a subset of the total data.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application] --> B[Sharding Logic/Proxy]
    
    B -->|User IDs 1-1000| C[Shard 1]
    B -->|User IDs 1001-2000| D[Shard 2]
    B -->|User IDs 2001-3000| E[Shard 3]
    B -->|User IDs 3001+| F[Shard N]
    
    style B fill:#fff4e1
    style C fill:#e8f5e9
    style D fill:#e8f5e9
    style E fill:#e8f5e9
    style F fill:#e8f5e9
```

### Sharding Strategies

#### 1. Range-Based Sharding
- Data divided by ranges (e.g., A-M in Shard 1, N-Z in Shard 2)
- Simple to implement
- Risk of uneven distribution (hot shards)

#### 2. Hash-Based Sharding
- Apply hash function to shard key
- Even distribution
- Difficult to perform range queries
- Resharding requires data movement

```javascript
// Hash-based shard determination (conceptual)
function getShardId(userId, totalShards) {
    return hash(userId) % totalShards;
}
```

#### 3. Geographic Sharding
- Data stored based on user location
- Low latency for regional users
- Regulatory compliance (data residency)

#### 4. Directory-Based Sharding
- Lookup table maps keys to shards
- Flexible shard assignment
- Directory becomes a potential bottleneck

### Choosing a Shard Key

**Good Shard Key Characteristics:**
- High cardinality (many unique values)
- Even distribution
- Minimizes cross-shard queries
- Aligns with access patterns

**Common Shard Keys:**
- User ID
- Tenant ID (multi-tenant apps)
- Geographic region
- Time/Date (for time-series data)

### Challenges with Sharding

**1. Cross-Shard Queries:**
- Queries spanning multiple shards are expensive
- Requires aggregation logic in application layer
- Increased latency

**2. Rebalancing:**
- Adding/removing shards requires data migration
- Consistent hashing can minimize resharding
- Downtime or performance impact during rebalancing

**3. Referential Integrity:**
- Foreign keys across shards are difficult
- Application-level integrity checks
- Denormalization may be necessary

**4. Operational Complexity:**
- Multiple databases to manage
- Backup and recovery complexity
- Monitoring and alerting

## Database Clustering

Database clustering groups multiple servers to work as a single system.

### Shared-Disk Clustering

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application] --> B[DB Node 1]
    A --> C[DB Node 2]
    A --> D[DB Node 3]
    
    B --> E[Shared Storage]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    
    style E fill:#ffe1e1
```

- Multiple nodes access same storage
- Active-active or active-passive configuration
- High availability
- Storage can be a bottleneck

### Shared-Nothing Clustering

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application] --> B[Coordinator]
    B --> C[DB Node 1<br/>Local Storage]
    B --> D[DB Node 2<br/>Local Storage]
    B --> E[DB Node 3<br/>Local Storage]
```

- Each node has independent storage
- Data distributed across nodes
- Better scalability
- More complex data management

## Caching Layer

Implementing a cache layer reduces database load significantly.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application] --> B{Cache<br/>Redis/Memcached}
    B -->|Cache Hit| A
    B -->|Cache Miss| C[Database]
    C --> B
    C --> A
    
    style B fill:#fff9e1
    style C fill:#e8f5e9
```

### Caching Strategies

**1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):**
- Application checks cache first
- On miss, loads from DB and populates cache
- Good for read-heavy workloads

**2. Write-Through:**
- Write to cache and DB simultaneously
- Strong consistency
- Higher write latency

**3. Write-Behind (Write-Back):**
- Write to cache immediately
- Async write to DB
- Lower write latency
- Risk of data loss

**4. Refresh-Ahead:**
- Automatically refresh cache before expiration
- Reduced cache misses
- Requires predictable access patterns

**What to Cache:**
- Frequently accessed data
- Expensive query results
- Session data
- User profiles
- Static content

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Time-based expiration (TTL)
- Event-driven invalidation
- Write-through invalidation
- Manual purging

**Reference:** See [caching_strategies.md](./caching_strategies.md) for comprehensive caching patterns.

## Read/Write Splitting

Separating read and write operations optimizes database performance.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application] --> B[Database Proxy/Router]
    B -->|Write Operations| C[Master DB]
    B -->|Read Operations| D[Read Replica 1]
    B -->|Read Operations| E[Read Replica 2]
    B -->|Read Operations| F[Read Replica 3]
    
    C -.->|Replication| D
    C -.->|Replication| E
    C -.->|Replication| F
    
    style C fill:#ffcccc
    style D fill:#ccffcc
    style E fill:#ccffcc
    style F fill:#ccffcc
```

### Implementation Approaches

**1. Application-Level:**
- Application logic routes queries
- Full control over routing logic
- Increased application complexity

**2. Proxy-Level:**
- Database proxy handles routing (ProxySQL, MaxScale)
- Transparent to application
- Single point of failure (use HA proxy)

**3. Driver-Level:**
- Database driver handles routing
- No additional infrastructure
- Limited to supported languages/frameworks

### Considerations

**Replication Lag:**
- Replicas may be slightly behind master
- Can cause "read your own write" issues
- Solutions: Read from master for recent writes, sticky sessions

**Load Distribution:**
- Distribute reads across multiple replicas
- Monitor replica lag
- Remove slow replicas from pool

**Reference:** See [load_balancing.md](./load_balancing.md) for traffic distribution strategies.

## Connection Pooling

Connection pooling reuses database connections to reduce overhead.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[App Thread 1] --> B[Connection Pool]
    C[App Thread 2] --> B
    D[App Thread 3] --> B
    E[App Thread N] --> B
    
    B --> F[DB Connection 1]
    B --> G[DB Connection 2]
    B --> H[DB Connection 3]
    B --> I[DB Connection M]
    
    F --> J[(Database)]
    G --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J
    
    style B fill:#fff4e1
```

### Benefits
- Reduced connection overhead
- Better resource utilization
- Controlled concurrency
- Improved response times

### Configuration Parameters

**Pool Size:**
- Min connections: Always available
- Max connections: Upper limit
- Formula: `connections = (core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count`

**Connection Lifecycle:**
- Max lifetime: Prevent stale connections
- Idle timeout: Close unused connections
- Connection validation: Test before use

**Wait Policy:**
- Queue requests when pool exhausted
- Timeout after specified duration
- Reject immediately vs wait

### Popular Connection Poolers
- **HikariCP** (Java)
- **PgBouncer** (PostgreSQL)
- **ProxySQL** (MySQL)
- **Connection pooling libraries** in frameworks (Django, Rails, etc.)

## Data Denormalization

Denormalization trades storage and update complexity for read performance.

### When to Denormalize

**Read Performance Critical:**
- Frequently accessed data
- Complex joins are expensive
- Read-heavy workloads

**Acceptable Trade-offs:**
- Some data redundancy is okay
- Eventual consistency acceptable
- Write performance less critical

### Denormalization Techniques

**1. Duplicate Data:**
- Store computed values
- Avoid expensive aggregations
- Example: Store `order_total` instead of calculating from line items

**2. Materialized Views:**
- Pre-computed query results
- Refresh periodically or on-demand
- Great for reporting and analytics

**3. Aggregate Tables:**
- Pre-aggregate metrics
- Daily/hourly summaries
- Reduces real-time computation

**4. Embedded Documents (NoSQL):**
- Store related data together
- Eliminates joins
- Example: Embed user address in user document

### Maintaining Consistency

**Application-Level:**
- Update all denormalized copies
- Use transactions where possible
- Handle failures gracefully

**Event-Driven:**
- Publish events on data changes
- Async updates to denormalized data
- Eventual consistency

**Reference:** See [eventual_consistency.md](./eventual_consistency.md) for consistency patterns.
