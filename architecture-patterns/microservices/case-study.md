**Timeline:** 2001-present  
**Primary Driver:** Monolith bottlenecks, team scalability

### Business Context

By 2001, Amazon's monolithic application had become a significant impediment to growth. Deployments required coordination across dozens of teams, took hours, and any bug could bring down the entire website. The architecture couldn't support Amazon's ambitious expansion plans.

**Critical Problems:**
- Deployment took 6+ hours
- Required coordination across 50+ teams
- Any bug affected entire site
- Database scaling limitations
- Team dependencies created bottlenecks
- Unable to experiment rapidly

### The Mandate

Jeff Bezos famously mandated in 2002:
- All teams expose data and functionality through service interfaces
- Teams must communicate through these interfaces
- No other inter-process communication allowed
- Technology agnostic (teams choose their stack)
- All interfaces must be designed to be externalized

This became the foundation for both Amazon's SOA and AWS.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

**Core Principles:**

1. **Service Ownership**
   - Each team owns complete services
   - Full lifecycle responsibility
   - "You build it, you run it" philosophy

### Timeline Architecture

**The Fan-Out Problem:**

When user tweets, how do you update followers' timelines?

**Approach 1: Fan-Out on Read**
- Store tweets centrally
- When user opens timeline, query tweets from followed users
- Merge and sort in real-time

**Pros:**
- Simple write (just store tweet)
- No wasted work

**Cons:**
- Slow reads (query many users)
- High database load
- Poor user experience

**Approach 2: Fan-Out on Write**
- When tweet posted, write to all followers' timelines
- Reading timeline is simple lookup

**Pros:**
- Fast reads (pre-computed)
- Good user experience

**Cons:**
- Expensive writes for celebrities (millions of followers)
- Lots of storage

**Twitter's Hybrid Approach:**

**Regular Users (< 100K followers):**
- Fan-out on write
- Async worker writes to follower timelines
- Uses Redis cache for timeline storage

**Celebrities (> 100K followers):**
- Fan-out on read for most followers
- Fan-out on write for active followers only
- Merge celebrity tweets at read time

**Implementation:**
1. Tweet posted
2. Check user's follower count
3. If < 100K: Queue fan-out job
4. If > 100K: Store in separate cache
5. Timeline read merges both sources

**Benefits:**
- Balanced approach
- Good performance for all users
- Scalable to celebrity accounts

### Real-Time Streaming

**Problem:** Show new tweets in real-time without polling

**Solution:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) / WebSockets

**Architecture:**
1. User connects to streaming API
2. Connection maintained with long-polling/WebSocket
3. New tweets pushed to client immediately
4. Connection pool managed per datacenter

**Technologies:**
- **Heron:** Real-time stream processing (replaced Storm)
- **Apache Kafka:** Event streaming
- **Redis:** Real-time caching

**Heron Benefits:**
- Developed at Twitter, open-sourced
- Better resource isolation than Storm
- Easier debugging
- Backpressure handling
- Compatible with Storm API

### Search and Discovery

**Earlybird - Real-Time Search:**

Custom search engine for tweets:
- Inverted index for full-text search
- Real-time indexing (tweets searchable in seconds)
- Distributed across many nodes
- Time-based sharding (recent tweets prioritized)

**How It Works:**
1. Tweet published
2. Indexed within seconds
3. Searchable immediately
4. Older tweets moved to slower storage

**Trending Topics:**

Algorithm to find what's trending:
1. Track all hashtags and phrases

## Lessons Learned

### Common Themes Across All Case Studies

After examining seven major companies' microservices journeys, several patterns emerge:

### 1. There's No Perfect Starting Point

**Key Insight:** Every company started migration for different reasons at different times.

- **Netflix:** After catastrophic database failure
- **Amazon:** Scaling and team coordination issues
- **Uber:** Real-time requirements
- **Spotify:** Organizational scaling
- **Twitter:** "Fail Whale" outages
- **Airbnb:** Monolith complexity
- **LinkedIn:** Data processing bottlenecks

**Takeaway:** Start when pain points are clear, not because it's trendy.

### 2. Gradual Migration Beats Big Bang

**All Companies Used Incremental Approach:**

- **Strangler Fig Pattern:** Build new alongside old
- **Parallel Running:** Keep monolith while extracting
- **Learn as You Go:** Early services inform later ones
- **Business Continuity:** Never stop serving customers

**Why Gradual Works:**
- Lower risk
- Continuous learning
- Can course-correct
- Teams adapt gradually
- Business keeps running

**Why Big Bang Fails:**
- High risk
- Can't course-correct
- All-or-nothing
- Team overwhelm
- Business disruption

### 3. Conway's Law Is Real

**Organization structure influences architecture:**

- **Amazon:** Two-pizza teams → Small autonomous services
- **Spotify:** Squad model → Service per squad
- **Netflix:** Freedom and responsibility → Independent services
- **Uber:** Product teams
