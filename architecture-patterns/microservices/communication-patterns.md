## Introduction

In a microservices architecture, services need to communicate with each other to fulfill business requirements. Unlike monolithic applications where components communicate through in-process calls, microservices communicate over the network, introducing complexity in terms of reliability, latency, and failure handling.

This document explores various communication patterns, their implementations, trade-offs, and best practices. For a comprehensive overview of microservices architecture, refer to [readme.md](./readme.md). For service discovery mechanisms, see [service-registry.md](./service-registry.md).

### Key Considerations

- **Reliability**: Network calls can fail
- **Latency**: Network communication is slower than in-process calls
- **Serialization**: Data must be serialized/deserialized
- **Versioning**: Services may evolve independently
- **Security**: Communication must be secured

---

## Communication Styles

Microservices can communicate in two fundamental styles:

### 1. Synchronous Communication

The client sends a request and waits for a response from the service. The client cannot proceed until it receives a response or the request times out.

**Characteristics:**
- Blocking operation
- Immediate response expected
- Tight temporal coupling
- Request-Response pattern

### 2. Asynchronous Communication

The client sends a request and continues processing without waiting for an immediate response. The service processes the request and may respond later through callbacks, events, or messages.

**Characteristics:**
- Non-blocking operation
- Eventual response or no response
- Loose temporal coupling
- Fire-and-forget or Event-driven patterns

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Synchronous Communication"
        A[Client] -->|Request| B[Service]
        B -->|Response| A
        A -->|Blocked waiting| A
    end
    
    subgraph "Asynchronous Communication"
        C[Client] -->|Message| D[Message Broker]
        D -->|Deliver| E[Service]
        C -->|Continue Processing| C
    end
```

## Synchronous Communication

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST is the most common synchronous communication protocol in microservices architecture.

**Characteristics:**
- HTTP-based protocol
- Resource-oriented design
- Stateless communication
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Human-readable format (JSON, XML)

**Example Flow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API Gateway
    participant Order Service
    participant Inventory Service
    
    Client->>API Gateway: POST /orders
    API Gateway->>Order Service: Create Order
    Order Service->>Inventory Service: GET /inventory/item/123
    Inventory Service-->>Order Service: Inventory Data
    Order Service-->>API Gateway: Order Created
    API Gateway-->>Client: 201 Created
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple and widely understood
- Language agnostic
- Easy to debug and test
- Extensive tooling support
- Cacheable responses

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher latency compared to binary protocols
- Larger payload size
- Limited streaming capabilities
- HTTP overhead

**Best Use Cases:**
- Public APIs
- CRUD operations
- Simple request-response scenarios
- When human readability is important

### gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call)

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC framework developed by Google.

**Characteristics:**
- Uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for serialization
- HTTP/2 based
- Supports bi-directional streaming
- Strongly typed contracts
- Efficient binary protocol

**Example Service Definition:**

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service OrderService {
  rpc CreateOrder (OrderRequest) returns (OrderResponse);
  rpc GetOrder (OrderId) returns (Order);
  rpc StreamOrders (Empty) returns (stream Order);
}

message OrderRequest {
  string customer_id = 1;
  repeated OrderItem items = 2;
}
```

**Communication Flow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Order Service (gRPC)
    participant Payment Service (gRPC)
    
    Client->>Order Service (gRPC): CreateOrder(orderRequest)
    Order Service (gRPC)->>Payment Service (gRPC): ProcessPayment(paymentRequest)
    Payment Service (gRPC)-->>Order Service (gRPC): PaymentResponse
    Order Service (gRPC)-->>Client: OrderResponse
```

**Advantages:**
- High performance (smaller payload, faster serialization)
- Bi-directional streaming
- Built-in code generation
- Strong typing and contract-first design
- Multiplexing over single TCP connection

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited browser support
- Less human-readable
- Steeper learning curve
- Requires HTTP/2 infrastructure

**Best Use Cases:**
- Internal service-to-service communication
- Real-time communication
- Polyglot environments
- High-performance requirements

### GraphQL

GraphQL provides a query language for APIs, allowing clients to request exactly what they need.

**Characteristics:**
- Single endpoint
- Client-defined queries
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching
- Strong typing with schema
- Introspection capabilities

**Advantages:**
- Flexible data retrieval
- Reduces number of requests
- Self-documenting
- Versioning not required

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex caching
- Potential for expensive queries
- Requires resolver implementation
- Query complexity management needed

---

## Asynchronous Communication

### Message Queue Pattern

Message queues enable asynchronous communication through a message broker that stores messages until they are processed.

**Architecture:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Producer Service] -->|Publish Message| B[Message Queue]
    B -->|Consume Message| C[Consumer Service 1]
    B -->|Consume Message| D[Consumer Service 2]
    B -->|Consume Message| E[Consumer Service 3]
```

**Common Message Brokers:**
- **RabbitMQ**: AMQP-based, reliable, supports complex routing
- **Apache Kafka**: High-throughput, distributed streaming platform
- **AWS SQS/SNS**: Managed cloud services
- **Azure Service Bus**: Enterprise messaging service
- **Redis Streams**: Lightweight streaming solution

**Message Queue Patterns:**

#### 1. Point-to-Point (Queue)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer
    participant Queue
    participant Consumer
    
    Producer->>Queue: Send Message
    Note over Queue: Message stored
    Consumer->>Queue: Poll/Pull Message
    Queue-->>Consumer: Deliver Message
    Consumer->>Queue: Acknowledge
```

**Characteristics:**
- One message, one consumer
- Message deleted after consumption
- Load balancing across consumers

#### 2. Publish-Subscribe (Topic)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Publisher
    participant Topic
    participant Subscriber1
    participant Subscriber2
    participant Subscriber3
    
    Publisher->>Topic: Publish Event
    Topic->>Subscriber1: Deliver Event
    Topic->>Subscriber2: Deliver Event
    Topic->>Subscriber3: Deliver Event
```

**Characteristics:**
- One message, multiple consumers
- Message broadcast to all subscribers
- Decoupled publishers and subscribers

### Event-Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture is a pattern where services communicate through events representing state changes. For detailed patterns, see the [event-driven](../event-driven/) documentation.

**Event Types:**

1. **Domain Events**: Business-significant occurrences (OrderPlaced, PaymentCompleted)
2. **Integration Events**: Cross-service communication events
3. **System Events**: Technical events (ServiceStarted, ConfigChanged)

**Event Flow:**

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Order Service] -->|OrderPlaced Event| B[Event Bus]
    B -->|Subscribe| C[Inventory Service]
    B -->|Subscribe| D[Notification Service]
    B -->|Subscribe| E[Analytics Service]
    
    C -->|InventoryReserved Event| B
    D -->|EmailSent Event| B
    E -->|DataRecorded Event| B
```

**Event Sourcing Pattern:**

For comprehensive coverage of event sourcing, refer to [event-sourcing](../event-sourcing/) documentation.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Command Handler
    participant Aggregate
    participant Event Store
    participant Event Bus
    participant Read Model
    
    Command Handler->>Aggregate: Execute Command
    Aggregate->>Event Store: Persist Event
    Event Store->>Event Bus: Publish Event
    Event Bus->>Read Model: Update Projection
```

**Advantages of Asynchronous Communication:**
- Loose coupling between services
- Better fault tolerance
- Improved scalability
- Natural support for eventual consistency
- Decoupled service lifecycles

**Disadvantages:**
- Increased complexity
- Debugging challenges
- Message ordering issues
- Duplicate message handling required
- Eventual consistency model

## Design Patterns

### 1. API Gateway Pattern

An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for clients, routing requests to appropriate microservices.

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client Applications] --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    
    Gateway --> Auth[Authentication Service]
    Gateway --> Order[Order Service]
    Gateway --> Product[Product Service]
    Gateway --> User[User Service]
    
    Order --> Inventory[Inventory Service]
    Order --> Payment[Payment Service]
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Request routing and composition
- Protocol translation
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Caching

**Related Documentation:**
- See [pros-cons.md](./pros-cons.md) for API Gateway trade-offs
- See [case-study.md](./case-study.md) for implementation examples

### 2. Service Mesh Pattern

A service mesh provides infrastructure-level communication between services with built-in capabilities.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Service Mesh"
        A[Service A] --- AP[Sidecar Proxy A]
        B[Service B] --- BP[Sidecar Proxy B]
        C[Service C] --- CP[Sidecar Proxy C]
        
        AP <--> BP
        BP <--> CP
        AP <--> CP
        
        Control[Control Plane] -.->|Configure| AP
        Control -.->|Configure| BP
        Control -.->|Configure| CP
    end
```

**Popular Service Meshes:**
- **Istio**: Comprehensive, feature-rich
- **Linkerd**: Lightweight, performant
- **Consul Connect**: HashiCorp ecosystem integration
- **AWS App Mesh**: AWS-native solution

**Features:**
- Traffic management
- Security (mTLS)
- Observability
- Resilience (circuit breakers, retries)
- Load balancing

### 3. Saga Pattern

The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions across multiple services. For detailed coverage, see [event-driven](../event-driven/) and [event-sourcing](../event-sourcing/) documentation.

**Choreography-based Saga:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Order Service
    participant Payment Service
    participant Inventory Service
    participant Shipping Service
    
    Order Service->>Payment Service: OrderCreated Event
    Payment Service->>Inventory Service: PaymentCompleted Event
    Inventory Service->>Shipping Service: InventoryReserved Event
    Shipping Service->>Order Service: ShippingScheduled Event
    
    Note over Order Service: Saga Completed
```

**Orchestration-based Saga:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Saga Orchestrator
    participant Payment Service
    participant Inventory Service
    participant Shipping Service
    
    Client->>Saga Orchestrator: Create Order
    Saga Orchestrator->>Payment Service: Process Payment
    Payment Service-->>Saga Orchestrator: Payment Success
    Saga Orchestrator->>Inventory Service: Reserve Inventory
    Inventory Service-->>Saga Orchestrator: Reserved
    Saga Orchestrator->>Shipping Service: Schedule Shipping
    Shipping Service-->>Saga Orchestrator: Scheduled
    Saga Orchestrator-->>Client: Order Completed
```

### 4. Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern

Different client applications have different needs. BFF provides tailored APIs for each client type.

```mermaid
graph TB
    Web[Web Client] --> WebBFF[Web BFF]
    Mobile[Mobile Client] --> MobileBFF[Mobile BFF]
    IoT[IoT Devices] --> IoTBFF[IoT BFF]
    
    WebBFF --> Services[Microservices]
    MobileBFF --> Services
    IoTBFF --> Services
```

**Benefits:**
- Optimized for specific client needs
- Reduced client complexity
- Independent evolution of client APIs
- Better performance (tailored data)

### 5. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout expires
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failure
    
    note right of Closed
        Requests pass through normally
        Failures are counted
    end note
    
    note right of Open
        Requests fail immediately
        No calls to downstream service
    end note
    
    note right of HalfOpen
        Limited requests allowed
        Testing if service recovered
    end note
```

**States:**
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open**: Service failure detected, requests fail fast
- **Half-Open**: Testing if service recovered

**Libraries:**
- Resilience4j (Java)
- Polly (.NET)
- Hystrix (Java, deprecated but influential)
- Circuit Breaker (Go)

## Best Practices

### 1. Timeouts and Retries

Always implement timeouts and retry logic with exponential backoff.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Service
    
    Client->>Service: Request (Attempt 1)
    Note over Service: Timeout
    Client->>Service: Request (Attempt 2, wait 1s)
    Note over Service: Timeout
    Client->>Service: Request (Attempt 3, wait 2s)
    Service-->>Client: Success
```

**Retry Strategy:**
- Use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- Implement jitter to avoid thundering herd
- Set maximum retry attempts
- Use idempotency tokens

### 2. Idempotency

Ensure operations can be safely retried without side effects.

**Techniques:**
- Idempotency keys/tokens
- Natural idempotent operations (PUT, DELETE)
- Deduplicate based on message IDs
- Store operation results

### 3. Service Discovery

Services must find each other dynamically. For comprehensive coverage, see [service-registry.md](./service-registry.md).

**Client-Side Discovery:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] -->|1. Query| B[Service Registry]
    B -->|2. Service Instances| A
    A -->|3. Direct Request| C[Service Instance]
```

**Server-Side Discovery:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] -->|Request| B[Load Balancer]
    B -->|Query| C[Service Registry]
    B -->|Forward| D[Service Instance]
```

### 4. Data Consistency

**Strategies:**
- **Strong Consistency**: Synchronous, 2PC (Two-Phase Commit)
- **Eventual Consistency**: Asynchronous, event-driven
- **Saga Pattern**: Compensating transactions
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

For detailed patterns, see [cqrs](../cqrs/) and [event-sourcing](../event-sourcing/) documentation.

### 5. Versioning Strategies

**API Versioning:**
- URI versioning: `/v1/orders`, `/v2/orders`
- Header versioning: `Accept: application/vnd.api.v2+json`
- Query parameter: `/orders?version=2`

**Message Versioning:**
- Schema evolution with backward compatibility
- Include version in message metadata
- Support multiple versions simultaneously
- Graceful deprecation

### 6. Observability

Implement comprehensive monitoring and tracing:

**Components:**
- **Logging**: Centralized log aggregation (ELK, Splunk)
- **Metrics**: Performance and health metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry)

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Service A] -->|Logs| E[Log Aggregator]
    A -->|Metrics| F[Metrics Collector]
    A -->|Traces| G[Trace Collector]
    
    B[Service B] -->|Logs| E
    B -->|Metrics| F
    B -->|Traces| G
    
    C[Service C] -->|Logs| E
    C -->|Metrics| F
    C -->|Traces| G
    
    E --> H[Centralized Dashboard]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

### 7. Security Considerations

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Service-to-service authentication (mTLS)
- API keys for external services

**Data Security:**
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement secret management
- Network segmentation

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Monolithic Communication"
        M1[Module A] -.->|In-Process Call| M2[Module B]
        M2 -.->|In-Process Call| M3[Module C]
    end
    
    subgraph "Microservices Communication"
        S1[Service A] -->|Network Call| S2[Service B]
        S2 -->|Network Call| S3[Service C]
        S1 -->|Event| MB[Message Broker]
        MB -->|Event| S3
    end
```
