# 📚 System Design Repository

A comprehensive resource for learning and mastering System Design concepts, patterns, and real-world architectures.
This repository is designed to grow into a living knowledge base with well-structured documentation, examples, and case studies—covering everything from fundamentals to modern distributed systems and microservices.

## 🚀 Vision
This repo aims to:
- 📖 Provide structured documentation on system design concepts.
- 🏗️ Offer hands-on examples of architecture patterns.
- 🔗 Serve as a reference guide for interviews and real-world projects.
- 🌍 Cover frontend + backend + microservices architectures.
- 🧩 Grow into a one-stop learning hub for programmers of all levels.
